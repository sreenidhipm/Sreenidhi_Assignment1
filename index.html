<!-- I have made this quiz game with the very minimal knowledge I have on HTML and CSS. I tried to play around with a few CSS selectors I remember learning. It consists of 4 questions, 2 images used (as asked) and an answer key. The answer key has external links to topics that anyone playing this game wishes to learn about.-->
